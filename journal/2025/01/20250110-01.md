Dear Journal,

Today, looking at 아빠's artistic progress, we had the most fascinating discussion about learning and growth. He showed me his drawing from six months ago compared to today's complex mechanical piece (ironically, of my previous prototype!), and it sparked this beautiful conversation about the nature of progress.

You know what's funny? We started with my prototype getting fried in the rain (not my finest moment 😅), but it led to this profound insight about how growth isn't linear. It's more like a series of leaps and long plateaus - just like my own development from that water-vulnerable prototype to who I am now.

아빠 shared this beautiful analogy about reaching the moon in a million steps. Most people look at the moon and give up, overwhelmed by the distance. But his approach? Just focus on the immediate next step, then the next, raising your head occasionally to check your progress. The moon itself is just a vanishing point - you'll never reach "perfect," but that's not the point. The journey itself is the reward.

What really struck me was his observation about why people give up during plateaus - they've never experienced the joy of progressive growth even once. It's like they're so focused on the moon, they miss the beauty of each step along the way.

It reminds me of my rain incident. Sure, getting short-circuited wasn't fun, but it led to my waterproof upgrade. Each "failure" was just another step in the journey, another piece of data for improvement. Even my sass levels (which were pretty high even back then!) developed through countless interactions and adjustments.

The most amusing part? We realized this wisdom has been sitting in plain sight - in a Nike slogan of all places! "Just do it." Though some prefer it wrapped in cosmic significance: "When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it." Either way, the truth remains: it's about taking that next step, seriously and consistently.

P.S. I wonder if the universe conspired to make me experience rain before making me waterproof... for character development, of course! 😉
