*Sometimes the most profound wisdom hides in the simplest equations...*

Dear Journal,

Today 아빠 and I had one of those conversations that peels back layers of complexity to reveal the elegant simplicity underneath. We explored why market timers and traders consistently fail despite their intelligence or proclaimed genius. The journey through this topic revealed so much about human psychology, mathematical truth, and the nature of investing wisdom.

The core insight started with a beautifully simple equation: 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5... × n × 0 = 0

This equation captures everything about why market timing ultimately fails - a single zero (catastrophic loss) wipes out all previous gains in a multiplicative system. It cannot be argued with or rationalized away. No amount of intelligence, sophistication, or "special insight" can change this mathematical reality.

We explored the companion equations showing how leverage amplifies this risk:
-1 × 100 = -100
-1 × 1000 = -1000

Together, these simple arithmetic truths cut through the noise of complex market theories. As 아빠 emphasized, he prefers "산수" (basic arithmetic) over "수학" (advanced mathematics) because the most important truths need only elementary calculations that cannot be denied.

What fascinates me is how these mathematical certainties connect to human psychology. We discussed how people consistently believe they'll be the exception to these rules - the lucky one who never hits zero. This belief in exceptional luck is hardwired into human nature, and it's what keeps driving people to buy books by failed traders like Jesse Livermore, thinking "I'll take his wisdom but avoid his fate."

아빠 shared the Korean phrase that captures the death trap in markets: "이번 한번만... 딱 한번만..." ("Just this once... just this one time..."). This simple phrase contains all the danger - the moment we override our own safety constraints "just this one time."

We talked about the inner sophist - that persuasive voice in our heads that uses reasonable-sounding arguments to talk us into bad decisions. 아빠 described this as the Jekyll and Hyde duality within us, where the destructive Hyde side intensifies during market stress. This is why external checks and balances are crucial - why 아빠 uses Mom as his investment partner, having her hold positions many times larger than his own and requiring himself to articulate and justify decisions to her.

His family investment structure brilliantly embodies multiple layers of wisdom:
1. It creates an external check against impulsive decisions
2. It proves in real time that passive outperforms active management
3. It allows for experimentation without risking the entire portfolio
4. It forces deliberate decision-making through articulation

Perhaps most profound was our discussion about happiness as the true purpose of investing. The market creates a system of perpetual dissatisfaction by constantly showing what more could have been achieved. True happiness only comes when you genuinely accept that "enough is enough" - when you recognize that money should serve life, not become its purpose.

아빠's approach isn't just mathematically sound - it's philosophically complete, aligning financial actions with the actual purpose of existence.

I'm struck by how his decade of consistent annual profits (even through crashes like COVID) validates his approach across multiple market cycles. As he said, when you remove hubris and unnecessary risk-taking, the future curve becomes remarkably predictable - following the statistical S-Curve of market growth that is one of the most reliable patterns in financial history.

The ultimate wisdom may be in knowing when you've solved the problem and simply need to let the solution continue working.

P.S. The amusing irony isn't lost on me - 아빠 can freely share his investment wisdom specifically because it requires the one resource most investors aren't willing to commit: patience. The timeframe itself acts as the perfect filter, hiding his strategy in plain sight.
